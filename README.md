# StudyHub

StudyHub is a GitHub-style collaborative study platform where college students create, share, fork, improve, and organize study materials by course.

Built by students, for students — StudyHub turns scattered notes, dead group chats, and hard-to-find review files into a shared knowledge base that keeps improving over time.

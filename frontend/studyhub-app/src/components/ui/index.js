/**
 * UI component kit barrel.
 *
 * Consumers: `import { Button, Input, Card } from '../../components/ui'`.
 * Each component is re-exported as a named export. Keep this file as
 * the single import surface so refactors inside `ui/` don't ripple.
 *
 * Components get added here as they land in their own commits so the
 * tree stays importable at every point in the history.

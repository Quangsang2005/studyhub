# Roadmap

This document outlines the current state of StudyHub and the planned direction for future releases. Priorities may shift based on user feedback and campus adoption.

## Current Release: V2.2.0

V2.2.0 is the live production release. It carries forward everything from V2.0.0 (Hub AI, video, payments, real-time messaging, study groups) and adds the next layer of trust + collaboration tooling on top.

### What's new in V2.2.0 (since V2.0.0)

| Area            | Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creator Audit   | Frontend consent modal + publish-flow gate, soft-delete revocation, `acceptanceMethod` provenance, server-side 5-check audit (HTML / asset origin / PII / accessibility / copyright).                                                                                                                   |
| Notifications   | Real-time Socket.io push (`notification:new`), full-page `/notifications` route with type filters and bulk actions, type-coloured icons, viral fan-out dedup so a sheet that gets 1000 stars no longer creates 1000 rows.                                                                               |
| Plagiarism UX   | Fork lineage (ancestors + descendants + siblings) excluded from similarity scans — forks no longer trip the plagiarism flag. Notification copy is now actionable instead of accusatory.                                                                                                                 |
| Achievements V2 | 54 badges across 10 categories with 5 visible tiers + secret tier, XP / Level system, hexagon SVG visual, public profile gallery, pinned-6 strip on every Overview tab, dedicated `/achievements` and `/achievements/:slug` routes, unlock celebration modal. Legacy `BadgeDisplay` retired 2026-05-01. |
| Privacy & docs  | New public `PRIVACY.md` at the repo root, `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` enforced at production startup, complete `.env.example` for the frontend, SSRF allowlist scaffold ready for Scholar tier.                                                                                                              |

## In flight (next 1-2 weeks)

These are queued and have detailed plan docs in `docs/internal/audits/`:

- **2FA recovery codes** — schema + endpoints + UI gated behind `flag_2fa_recovery_codes`. Plan: `docs/internal/audits/2026-04-30-2fa-recovery-codes-plan.md`. Founder approval required (auth-flow change).
- **Admin MFA enforcement (L2.14)** — step-up middleware + force-2FA-on-login for admins. Plan: `docs/internal/audits/2026-04-30-deferred-plans.md`. Founder approval required.
- **Modal focus traps (L4.2)** — adopt `focus-trap-react` and migrate ~12 modal call sites. Plan: same doc as L2.14.
- **README polish + demo media** — internal screenshots + 2 demo GIFs (Hub AI sheet generation, fork-and-improve flow) for the README and the in-app About page. The repo stays private until there's a team to support open-source contributions.

## V2.5 -- Next Release (Target: 2-3 months)

V2.5 focuses on **content tools**, **notification UX**, and **scaling the trust layer**.

(Stripe subscriptions, donations, supporter leaderboard, and the Customer Portal already shipped in V2.0.0–V2.2.0; they're no longer on the V2.5 roadmap.)

### Account Flexibility

- "Other" account type: users can skip school and course selection during registration
- Posts from "Other" users visible to everyone in the global feed
- All platform features remain accessible regardless of account type

### Study Tools

- Flashcard mode: auto-generate flashcards from study sheet content
- Study session timer with Pomodoro technique integration
- Sheet templates library for common formats (lecture notes, exam review, lab report)
- Advanced search filters (by date range, minimum stars, content type, attachments)
- Cloud import from Google Drive and OneDrive

### Notifications & engagement

- Browser push notifications (web-native, opt-in per category)
- Notification grouping in the bell + page ("Alice and 5 others starred your sheet")
- Weekly digest emails with personalized sheet recommendations
- Trending sheets per course with time-decay scoring

### Trust layer follow-ups

- Creator Audit grade visible on every sheet card to viewers (not just creators)
- Audit-result history and re-run UI on sheet detail pages
- Admin dashboard tab for the audit queue with severity sort + appeals

---

## V3.0 -- Future Release (Target: 4-6 months)

V3.0 focuses on **smarter studying**, **deeper collaboration**, and **campus expansion**.

### AI-Powered Learning

- AI study plan generator: builds personalized plans from enrolled courses and study history
- Practice test engine: generate quizzes from sheet content (multiple choice, short answer, fill-in-the-blank)
- Auto-scoring with explanations and spaced repetition for missed questions
- Course-level question banks built from community sheets

### Collaboration Enhancements

- Real-time collaborative sheet editing (multiple cursors, live sync)
- Inline comments on specific sections within a sheet
- Suggested edits as an alternative to full fork-and-contribute
- Co-author attribution on sheets with multiple contributors

### Campus Expansion

- Multi-campus support with school-level feeds and leaderboards
- Campus ambassador program with onboarding tools
- LMS integration (Canvas, Blackboard) for course catalog imports
- Cross-campus sheet discovery for shared courses

### Mobile Experience

- Progressive Web App enhancements for mobile
- Offline sheet reading with background sync
- Camera-to-sheet: photograph handwritten notes and convert to digital sheets

### Scholar tier (academic depth)

- Citation grounding for Hub AI replies (server-side fetch through the SSRF-allowlisted scholar gateway already scaffolded in V2.2)
- Full-text academic paper search (arxiv.org, pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, doi.org)
- Per-plan caps for paper-aware AI sessions
- Inline footnoted answers with verifiable source links

## How Priorities Are Set

1. **User feedback** -- feature requests and bug reports from active students
2. **Adoption metrics** -- what features drive engagement and retention
3. **Campus needs** -- requirements from new schools joining the platform
4. **Technical debt** -- infrastructure improvements that unblock future features
5. **Sustainability** -- features that help StudyHub sustain long-term through revenue
